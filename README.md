## Game Overview

Shit Present or Poop is a simple either or game. When presented with a face, the player chooses if they think it’s in response to a terrible present or poop.
Each round (one time played through) consists of 5 faces (which should be pulled at random from the pool of 9 faces/options, so that every experience is a little different). The user makes their selection, and is answered with either “right” or “wrong” interstitial and accompanying sound effect.

At the end of the game, they will reach one of two endings depending on how many answers they got right. (4 or better answers correct gets a “congrats” message, while 3 or less gets the “Womp womp.”)

From here, they should be linked to a shopping experience (via the url on the page) or to share the game on social (via the icons).
